        <dt><span>Spain</span> or the Kingdom of Spain (Reino de España)</dt>
        <dd> is a country in southwestern Europe with parts of territory in the Atlantic Ocean and across the Mediterranean Sea.
            The largest part of Spain is situated on the Iberian Peninsula; its territory also includes the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea,
            and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla in Africa. The country's mainland is bordered to the south by Gibraltar; to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea; to the north
            by France, Andorra and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. With an area of 505,990 km2 (195,360 sq mi), Spain is the second-largest country in the European Union
            and, with a population exceeding 47.4 million, the fourth-most populous EU member state. Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid; other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza,
            Málaga, Murcia, Palma de Mallorca, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Bilbao.

    <h3>Demographics</h3>
    <p><i><b>Main article:</b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Spain"> Demographics of Spain</a></i></p>
    <p><strong>See also: List of Spanish autonomous communities by population</strong></p>
    <p id="par_one">
        In 2019, the population of Spain officially reached 47 million people, as recorded by the Padrón municipal (Spain's Municipal Register). Spain's population density, at 91 km<span id="sup">2</span>, is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal. With the exception of the region surrounding the capital, Madrid, the most populated areas lie around the coast. The population of Spain has risen 2 1/2 times since 1900, when it stood at 18.6 million, principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Population pyramid of Spain from 1950 to 2014</em><br>
        In 2017, the average total fertility rate (TFR) across Spain was 1.33 children born per woman, one of the lowest in the world, below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 5.11 children born per woman in 1865.[208] Spain subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 43.1 years.[209]
    </p>
    <p>
        Native Spaniards make up 88% of the total population of Spain. After the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and Spain's population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward initially upon the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population. The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (4%).[210] In 2005, Spain instituted a three-month amnesty programme through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residency.[211]
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2008, Spain granted citizenship to 84,170 persons, mostly to people from Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco.[212] Many foreign residents in Spain also come from other Western and Central European countries. These are mostly British, French, German, Dutch, and Norwegian. They reside primarily on the Mediterranean coast and the Balearic islands, where many are retired or remote workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="display_block">Substantial populations</span> descended from Spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world, most notably in Latin America. Beginning in the late 15th century, large numbers of Iberian colonists settled in what became Latin America and at present most white Latin Americans (who make up about one-third of Latin America's population) are of Spanish or Portuguese origin. Around 240,000 Spaniards emigrated in the 16th century, mostly to Mexico.[213] Another 450,000 left in the 17th century.[214] The estimate between 1492 and 1832 is 1.86 million.[215] Between 1846 and 1932 it is estimated that nearly 5 million Spaniards emigrated to the Americas, especially to Argentina and Brazil.[216] Approximately two million Spaniards migrated to other Western European countries between 1960 and 1975. During the same period perhaps 300,000 went to Latin America.[217]

    <p>
        <em>Almirante Juan de Borbón (F-102)</em>, a Spanish navy's F100 class frigate incorporating the Aegis Combat System.
        The armed forces of Spainare known as the Spanish Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas Españolas). Their commander-in-chief is the King of Spain, Felipe VI.[142]
    </p>
    <p>
        The next military authorities in line are the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence. The fourth military authority of the State is the Chief of the Defence Staff (JEMAD).[143] The Defence Staff (Estado Mayor de la Defensa) assists the JEMAD as auxiliary body.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Spanish Armed Forces are divided into three branches:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong class="strong_decoration">Army (Ejército de Tierra)</strong>
            <p>
              The <span>Spanish Army</span> consists of 15 active brigades and 6 military regions. Modern infantry have diverse capabilities and this is reflected in the varied roles assigned to them. There are four operational roles that infantry battalions can fulfil: air assault, armoured infantry, mechanised infantry, and light role infantry.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="strong_decoration">Navy (Armada)</strong>
            <p>
              Under the command of the Spanish Admiral Chief of Naval Staff, stationed in Madrid, the Spanish Navy has four area commands:<br>
            </p>
            <ul class="parent">
                <li>Cantabrian Maritime Zone with its headquarters at Ferrol on the Atlantic coast</li>
                <li>Straits Maritime Zone with its headquarters at San Fernando near Cadiz</li>
                <li>Mediterranean Maritime Zone with its headquarters at Cartagena</li>
                <li>Canary Islands Maritime Zone with its headquarters at Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
               The current flagship of the Spanish Navy is the amphibious assault ship/aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I. In addition, the fleet consists of: 2 amphibious transport docks, 11 frigates, 3 submarines, 6 mine countermeasure vessels, 23 patrol vessels and a number of auxiliary ships. The total displacement of the Spanish Navy is approximately 220,000 tonnes. As of 2012, the Armada has a strength of 20,838 personnel.[12]
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="strong_decoration">Air and Space Force (Ejército del Aire y del Espacio)</strong>
            <p>
              Spanish Air and Space Force currently has 10 fighter squadrons, each with 18-24 airplanes. The Air and Space Force also has 15 operational air bases around the country. The Air and Space Force operates a wide-ranging fleet of aircraft, from fighters to transport aircraft and passenger transports to helicopters. It maintains some 450 aircraft in total, of which around 130 are fighter aircraft (Eurofighter Typhoons and F-18 MLU). The Spanish Air and Space Force is replacing older aircraft in the inventory with newer ones including the recently introduced Eurofighter Typhoon and the Airbus A400M Atlas airlifter. Both are manufactured with Spanish participation; EADS CASA makes the Eurofighter's right wing and leading edge slats, and participates in the testing and assembly of the airlifter.[13] Its aerobatic display team is the Patrulla Aguila, which flies the CASA C-101 Aviojet.Its helicopter display team, Patrulla Aspa, flies the Eurocopter EC-120 Colibrí. In July 2014 the Spanish Air Force joined the European Air Transport Command, headquartered at Eindhoven Airbase in the Netherlands.
